Yes, you're thinking in the right direction. Let me now break everything down clearly step by step, including:

✅ 1. Dashboard Access: Who Needs What?
🧑‍💼 Authenticated User Dashboard (Normal User)
They should be able to:

View their profile

View their own swaps (requested, accepted, rejected, canceled)

View their own items

Update profile

Delete account

Logout

👑 Admin Dashboard
They should be able to:

View all users

Block/unblock users

Delete any user

View all swaps from all users

View reports/notifications

Manage system data

✅ 2. Required APIs for Dashboard
🔒 For Authenticated User:
API Route	Method	Description
/api/users/profile	GET	Get current logged in user's full profile
/api/users/profile	PUT	Update profile
/api/users/my-items	GET	Get all items created by the user
/api/swaps/my-swaps	GET	Get all swap requests created by the user
/api/users/delete-account	DELETE	Delete user account
/api/users/logout	POST	Logout user (if needed via API)

👑 For Admin Dashboard:
API Route	Method	Description
/api/admin/users	GET	Get all users
/api/admin/user/:id/block	PATCH	Block/unblock a user
/api/admin/user/:id	DELETE	Delete a user
/api/admin/swaps	GET	Get all swaps of all users
/api/admin/notifications	GET	View all system notifications
/api/admin/stats	GET	Dashboard stats: Total Users, Swaps, Items

🧠 Important: These routes must be protected with middleware like isAdmin and protect.

✅ 3. Do Admins Need Redux + Backend?
Yes.

Redux is needed for:

Storing fetched users, swaps

Handling loading/error states

Dispatching block/unblock, delete etc.

Backend is required to:

Handle all logic for admins (block user, see stats, etc.)

Create a secure interface between client and database

✅ 4. User Schema Explanation
You already shared this:

js
Copy
Edit
isAdmin: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false,
}
This is crucial.

A normal user will have isAdmin: false

An admin user will have isAdmin: true

Based on this, your backend can control access to certain APIs using middleware like:

js
Copy
Edit
const adminProtect = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user && req.user.isAdmin) {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).json({ message: "Not authorized as admin" });
  }
};
Then in routes:

js
Copy
Edit
router.get("/admin/users", protect, adminProtect, getAllUsers);
✅ Next Steps:
We'll create backend route files:

/routes/adminRoute.js

Add new controller functions in /controllers/adminController.js

Add Redux slices for admin state (like usersListSlice, adminStatsSlice)

Protect routes with middleware

Let me know if I can start by writing:

🧱 adminRoute.js

⚙️ adminController.js

🧠 adminMiddleware.js

Or first dashboard UI?

Which one should I begin with?
